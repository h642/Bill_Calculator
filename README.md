🛠️ Technical LogicClass Structure:
The product class contains private members for name, price, and quantity.Constructor: Initializes the product object, though the current logic primarily utilizes the display() method to handle bulk entries.Arrays & Loops: Uses parallel arrays within the display() function to store data for up to 100 products
